Solar energy is a crucial renewable resource, but the accumulation of dust, snow, bird droppings, and physical/electrical damage on solar panels reduces their efficiency. While manual monitoring is time-consuming and expensive, automated detection can help improve efficiency and reduce maintenance costs.
This project aims to develop machine learning models for both classification and object detection to accurately identify and localize different types of obstructions or damages on solar panels. The objective is to:
Classify solar panel images into six categories: Clean, Dusty, Bird-Drop, Electrical-Damage, Physical-Damage, and Snow-Covered.
Detect and localize the presence of dust, bird droppings, or damages on the panel using object detection models.
